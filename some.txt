Implement Content Filtering Logic:
In your JavaScript code, implement the logic to block or hide offensive and
sexual content on the current webpage. You may use DOM manipulation to
hide or remove elements containing such content.

Testing:
Test your extension by loading it as an unpacked extension
in Chrome. Go to chrome://extensions/, enable "Developer mode," and
click "Load unpacked." Select your extension directory.

Refinement and Improvement:
Continuously refine and improve your extension's content filtering
logic to make it more accurate and efficient.

Publishing (Optional):
If you want to make your extension available to others, you can
publish it on the Chrome Web Store after thoroughly testing and refining it.
